a superman game, GTA style but better a free roam world with specific goal or free roam. 1. rule can not be seen changing into Superman. 2. must uphold justice, his job, and Louis lane
I want a city like Metropolis, as well as Smallville and other small town, but as you progress you unlock other city's like Gotham and so on, eventually and finally unlocking other countries. With the final battle in this first installment against Doomsday.
I need a working world filled with cars, trucks, basically a working changing world. A cause and effect staying close to as real as it can get.
I will also have to developed a health meter where Superman gets his strength and healing power from the sun. But it drains quicker the more strength he has to use.
Also the damages and hurt civilians from his battles or even his simple mistakes must effect him and the public's perception of Superman, as well as Clark Kent.
Clark Kent must be able to Drive any car he wants. Preferable his own, but not nessicary seeing how the public's opinion of him will ultimately dictate the difficulty of Supermans, and Clark Kent's enviorments.
And yes you can either be a good Superman, or an evil Superman- free will is a Bitch👍👍👍.
Ultimately the choices Superman makes, and how he handles each and every situation dictates the end for Superman, pr the game
Also I'm thinking upgrades as you advance, wether you fly to Superman's Fortress and unlock them, to purchase them with something you can collect or even earn.
